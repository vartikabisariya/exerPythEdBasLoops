## Fork & Clone this repository

* We did this in a previous assignment. Instructions are here: https://github.com/cmcntsh/exerGitPractice
  * A reminder about forking a repository:
  * Forking a repository is copying it from an original GitHub account to your own GitHub account.
  * Forking a repository is done by clicking on the Fork button located at the top, right corner of the main repository page.
  * You can only fork a repository once. If you try to fork a repository on your own GitHub account, you'll get an error message. If you try to fork a repository you already forked (without deleting it on your own account first), you'll also get an error message that you already forked the repository.
* Cloning a repository can also be done directly in VSCode
  * Create a new folder on your machine where you want to put this repository if you don't already have one you want to use.
  * Copy the Clone or Download path for this repository from GitHub.
  * In VSCode from the command pallette (Ctrl-Shift-P) run Git: Clone
  * Paste the path into the path field which pops up
  * Select your new folder you created on your machine
  * A new folder for the repository with the repository files should be in the folder you selected showing in the Explorer window in VSCode on the left side.

## Complete the Jupyter Notebook

* If you're new to Jupyter Notebooks, here's a short demonstration of how to get started: https://youtu.be/H1qhgB2LyN8
* Go through the tutorial at https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-python-3-from-scratch/39MAKp0Ozq4
* Complete the exercises in the Jupyter Notebook which is included in this repository.
* The exercises follow very closely the instructional material on the site linked above. (Sometimes exactly, sometimes with some slight variation.)
* This notebook is only for the Loops section, so move to the next assignment when you've completed that section.

## Push your updated file to your GitHub repository

* This can be done in VSCode.
  * In VSCode click on the Source Control button.
  * You should see the files that had changes. (Mine has the original file which shows an M next to it and a new file which says checkpoint in the name. You really only need to push the original file, but if you push both it shouldn't hurt anything.)
  * Hover over the changed file. Click the + sign to stage the change.
  * Enter a commit message in the message field and click the checkmark to commit the change.
  * Click on the 3 dots for more actions and select Sync. This will push the updated file to your GitHub repository.
  * Submit the link to your GitHub repository on Canvas.
